Curve fitting is a mathematical technique used to find the best-fitting curve or mathematical model that approximates a set of data points.
It's particularly useful when you have data points and want to find a function that closely matches or describes the relationship between the variables.

 Use the sliders to adjust the values of m and b until the line represented by your model closely matches your data points. This process involves finding the values of 
m and b that minimize the error between the model and the data.

y1= m*x1 + b
